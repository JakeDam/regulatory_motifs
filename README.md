# Regulatory Motifs

## Coding Challenges from UCSD's Bioinformatics I Week 3

Python script that contains tools for characterizing regulatory motifs:
- hamming_dist: Calculates the Hamming Distance between two DNA sequences
- neighbors: Generates the d-neighborhood (set of all k-mers whose hamming distance from the pattern does not exceed d) of a DNA sequence 
- motif_enumeration: Identifies all (k,d)-motifs that appear in a collection of DNA sequences
